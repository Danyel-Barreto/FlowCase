# React Native SQLite Expo Demo

A demo application built with Expo and React Native, showcasing the integration of SQLite 
using expo-sqlite within an expo-router project. This app serves as an example of:
- Database SQLite Migration
- Integration Testing: Run integration tests for expo-sqlite in a Node.js environment.
The app functions as a simple "CRUD" (Create, Read, Delete) tasks manager.
